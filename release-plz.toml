# Keep the defaults simple and explicit. We rely on Cargo manifests for:
# - which crates are publishable (`publish = false` disables)
# - per-crate versioning (explicit `version = ...` for modules/sdks, and `version.workspace = true` for ModKit libs)
#
# NOTE: release-plz may temporarily checkout commits while computing diffs.
# Some repos can end up "dirty" due to generated/normalized files, so we allow it.

# NOTE: For the initial bootstrap (when crates may not exist on crates.io yet),
# semver checks are noisy and can fail. Re-enable after the first successful publish.
