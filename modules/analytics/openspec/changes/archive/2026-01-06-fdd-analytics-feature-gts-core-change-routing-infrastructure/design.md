# Design Reference

**MUST READ**: [Feature DESIGN.md](../../architecture/features/feature-gts-core/DESIGN.md)

**Agent Instruction**: This change implements routing infrastructure requirements from Feature DESIGN.md Section F. Read the full Feature DESIGN.md before implementation, paying special attention to:

- **Section B: Actor Flows** - Especially Flow 4 (GTS Core Routes CRUD Operations)
- **Section C: Algorithms** - Algorithm 1 (Routing Logic) for implementation details
- **Section E: Technical Details** - API Endpoints, Error Handling
- **Section F: Requirements** - `fdd-analytics-feature-gts-core-req-routing` for complete specification

This change has no dependencies and establishes the foundational routing layer for GTS Core.
