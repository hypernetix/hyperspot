# PR review local configuration.
# All review settings (prompts, templates, data dir) live in
# .cypilot/.cypilot-config.json → "pr" section.
# This file holds only local/per-repo overrides that should NOT be in cypilot config.

# PRs to skip when running `pr.py fetch ALL`, `pr.py status ALL`, or `pr.py list`.
# Add PR numbers as strings. These PRs will still be fetchable individually.
